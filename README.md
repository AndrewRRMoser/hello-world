Honoring the programming tradition of HelloWorld

My name is Andrew and I love soccer, sushi and self-help. Laughing at absurd and dumb jokes gets me through the day. I look up to Tony Robbins and anyone who's successful in several areas of their life, especially when it comes to how they treat others. I love cerebral, sci-fi and comedic genres. 

This last part goes a little deeper. I am a nerd who cares about others. I care because I thought life was hopeless and I don't want anyone else to go through that if I can help it. Depression, the darkest period of my life, has led to a much richer life filled with love and purpose. I am grateful for everything it had to teach about life and what's important. Now I want to help others be happy while leading richer, more fulfilling lives. The only question is how best to do that. Thanks for taking the time to get to know a little bit about me and I wish you happiness and success.
